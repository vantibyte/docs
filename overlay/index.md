# Overlay

The overlay is primarily used for stream overlays by providing "remote" production teams the ability to make changes to specific elements being shown on broadcast.
This is achieved by providing teams a Web UI (via Dash) to update the values to be shown on stream, and an API that is used by the broadcaster to show these on screen.
