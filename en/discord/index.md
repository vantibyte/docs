description: Details around the Vantibyte Discord
---

Discord is used as the primary method of support for Vantibyte solutions, as well as further discussion around your needs. We generally suggest that anyone who is interacting with our tools is invited, as this is the quickest way to get real-time assistance (if needed) from the team.

The first thing any new joiner will notice, is that we do not have any publicly accessible channels. Every team is given their own channel, and access to this is only given to our staff and the members of your team. Once anyone joins, they will be placed into a personal holding channel with instructions on how to proceed.

## VantiBot
