This page provides a list of our various solutions and a brief description. We're currently accepting beta users for these services, so please get in touch if you'd like to learn more or try them out!

## RTMP

Our primary service for production teams across all workflows, games and "traditional" media. It allows feeds to be shared in near-realtime with multiple users, allowing one feed to be seen by production and commentary teams simultaneously, before they get sent out for audience consumption.

## Meet

Allows unlimited length video calls, upto 40 participants, with full screen sharing, video and audio support.

## Overlay

A customisable interactive overlay for your productions. For example, showing the current map name, team logos and score - all editable by any member of your team anywhere in the world.

## Bans

Our map pick/ban tool, allowing to choose which maps to play, while providing a live customisable feed direct to the production desk.

## Dash

Allows you to control all of your Vantibyte products and services in one central place - and share controlled access with members of your team. Think of it like the toolbox, and the services, the tools.

## TeamSpeak

A fully hosted and managed teamspeak server setup for your needs to enable production discussions while live, in the highest quality voice codecs.

## Coming Soon

We want to add more products to help your needs! Whatever you need to help upgrade your productions, let us know. We'd love to discuss how we can help.
