### Authentication  

Specific authentication will be required for streaming to our platform, with the ability to manage the stream keys via Dash. This will achieve the following:

- Generate own named streams and key pairs via Dash
- Ability to issue "temporary" keys and revoke these when done
- Know exactly which streams are associated with your account
- Know which streams are currently in use, or recently used
- Protect the Vantibyte platform from potential abuse
- Enable tracking and statistics (spoiler!)

### Tracking and statistics

Some shiny statistics and tracking metrics will be on their way, to help you understand your usage.

- Which stream keys have been used, when, and for how long
- Which streams are watched the most (in total, not minute by minute)
- Identify any unexpected use of keys
